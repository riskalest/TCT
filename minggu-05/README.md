## About jExcel

The jExcel is a full original javascript software created as a jquery plugin to facilitate the data manipulation in web based applications. It was created to be an easy javascript data input tool for users and it was created inspired on the Handsontable and the Microsoft Excel.

This software is free and was created to be a light alternative to Handsontable javascript spreadsheet. So, some keywords in the configuration and initialization directives coulb be similar to make easy any migration from Handsontable to jExcel.

The first time we were involved in a web based spreadsheet development was in 2005, when we created the datagrid inspired in dhmlx. But, because the lack of audience we decided to discontinuate its development. A few years ago, we found and started to use Handsontable. It is a great piece of software. But, in a certain extension very complicated for integrations and sometimes limited, for example it is not possible to have a simple key-value dropdown. So, we decided to build something from the scratch, complete original but with a goal to keep as simple as possible any transition between any Handsontable to jExcel.

If you are a developer and likes Microsoft Excel, Handsontable, Datagrid or would like to give users a new user-friendly experience, you are in the right place. You can manipulate the jExcel javascript spreadsheet data with JSON, CSV or simple arrays, so it will be easy to integrate jExcel to any of your applications. We would like to make sure you will have a great start with our tool, so if you have any question, just let us know. We are always willing to help. All for free!
